Shift is a minimalistic approach to maximum control of your Transmission.
===
Shift is a web interface for transmission-daemon. It is a complete implementation of the [Transmission RPC specification](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/blob/master/extras/rpc-spec.txt). It handles 10k+ torrents so you can manage all of your hosted Linux distribution torrents with a browser.

*Shift is targeted at Mozilla Firefox with degraded and untested functionality for other or older browsers.*

## Installation.

* Download the zip file from github and unzip on your machine where transmission-daemon resides. (Or use git clone for future easy updating.)
* Verify that transmission-daemon has proper access to the files. (See chmod and/or chown.)
* Set the [TRANSMISSION_WEB_HOME](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/wiki/Environment-Variables) environment variable to the path to where you placed the Shift files.      Example:
```bash
export TRANSMISSION_WEB_HOME=/my/path/to/the/unzipped/dir
```
*   If transmission-daemon is executed from a script you should put the export command in there.
*   If transmission-daemon is executed from systemd you should add an Environment line there.  Example:
```
[Service]
...
Environment=TRANSMISSION_WEB_HOME=/my/path/to/the/unzipped/dir
...
```
* (Re)start transmission-daemon.
* Once started any changes to index.html, shift.js or any other file will be picked up after a page reload.

## Drag & drop interface.

You can drop multiple files and links anywhere on the Shift page. Currently supported are torrent files, torrent links, magnet links and text files containing torrent links or magnet links. Using the [FileReader API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader) for uploading torrents to transmission-daemon was invented here. See [Can I use](https://caniuse.com/#search=filereader) for browser compatibility.

## Change less does more.

Why reload semi-static data each and every AJAX call? Shift tries to minimize the data consumption from transmission-daemon. This means using less bandwidth and less processing for transmission-daemon. Because of this saving the smaller requests can be made more often. Shift also works hard to not update cell data when it doesn't need to.

## Move content server-side.

You can (batch!) move your torrent content on the server with Shift. Select one or more torrents and select Relocate from the menu or go to the details page of a torrent and change the "downloadDir" property. The "Move" indicator needs to be active to actually move the data. Be aware that moving content across file-system boundaries takes resources away from other tasks on the server, including transmission-daemon itself. Beware of servercide.

## Column based sorting and filtering.

Click on the name in a column header and the table will be sorted by that column. Click on it again and the sorting order is reversed. Click on the LED in the column header, next to the name, and filtering input options are shown. By default only torrents currently downloading are shown and are sorted by percentDone in descending order. When you change the value of the "Status" filter the column view changes also to better suit the context of the filtered torrents.

## Files management.

* **Sorting**
The sorting of files contained in the torrent works similar to the sorting of torrents but with a twist or two. The first twist is that files are sorted by the given column and then the tree structure is changed to match the new sort order. The other twist is in the name column. By default it is sorted by torrent order in the exact sequence of files contained in the torrent. Click on the name column header and it is sorted by tree order, alphabetically and nested. If the files were added to the torrent in proper tree order then the view will not change.

* **Priorities**
Double-click on a torrent row to view the files contained in the torrent. The files are shown in a tree-like structure, with the important addition that this structure is fully functional. Change the download priority (high, normal, low, none) on a node, again from the context menu, and all sub-nodes are assigned the same priority. Oh, and you CAN change the priority of already downloaded files.

* **(Batch) Renaming**
You can rename files within a torrent. Be warned that when you remove a torrent with renamed files and later re-add the same torrent the renamed files will not be found when checking for existing content.

* **Links**
Files and folders in torrents can be downloaded or displayed directly from Shift, even if the files are not 100% complete. Go to Session/Shift to configure a base URL to be used as a prefix for the content or folders, ftp://myname@myserver/mydownloads/  for example. To make the complete URLs work you still need to install and configure a web/ftp/... server such as [Lighty](https://www.lighttpd.net/) to serve the file. Be warned that this is not for the novice user.
For testing purposes you could use transmission-daemon itself to serve the linked file. You need file-system access and enough permissions for some clever file placement and/or symbolic linking to make that work, though.
<sub>Hint: The files that make up the web interface for transmission-daemon are also stored somewhere on the server.</sub>

## Future/feature proof-ish.
The torrent details, session configuration and shift configuration pages all are dynamically generated from the data itself. So when developers add a simple field to the data, Shift will automagically display it and make it editable. Only if you, developer, need to hide a field, make it read-only or make it special/complex then you need to edit the shift.js file. If you activate "Copy to clipboard" and click "Apply", the data will be available in JSON format for pasting in any text editor.

Shift has some configuration parameters for the interface itself. They are stored in shift.json server-side and in a [cookie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) in your browser. Currently the interface can only update and persist the configuration in the cookie. You will need to manually update the shift.json file on the server to make it permanent across sessions and browsers.

* **notificationLevel** Receive browser notifications for certain events or errors. The higher the level the more types of notification will be displayed.
* **registerMagnetHandler** Registers Shift as the [protocol handler](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/registerProtocolHandler/Web-based_protocol_handlers) for magnet links.
* **soundDone** A URL to any supported audio file or empty for a generated beep sound.
* **torrentLink** A URL prefix to the torrentFile attribute in the torrent details to make it a complete URL. This is a prerequisite to activate the Recycle function to remove and re-add the torrent.
* **torrentLinkEnabled** This makes the torrentFile attribute in the torrent details a link.

Shift has some additional functionality on the Shift configuration page. The page must remain open to allow actions to finish as they are completely client-side/JavaScript driven.

* **minSeeders** Stop seeding torrents that have more than a minimum number of seeders.
* **trackers** Batch add tracker URLs to all torrents.
* **Set queue positions** Every time Transmission is started the torrents are queued randomly. Clicking "Date" reorders the torrents queuePositions by addedDate.

## Files not found? Remove + re-add? Recycle!
In rare cases a started torrent that stopped before any files could be written to disk cannot be restarted by Transmission. You can only remove and re-add the torrent to continue downloading the payload. If you have configured the torrentLink properly and you can download a torrent file from the torrent details page a Recycle option will be available in the torrents context menu of the main torrents view.

 ## Open for mutilation.

* "I really loved your old-skool green-on-black theme, just loved it!"
No problemo, it is still around but has been renamed to terminal.css. You can change the Session/Shift/styleSheet attribute.
* "I really need to have a column to show the eta of the torrents."
Then you need to add an "eta" entry in the torrentColumns object and you need to invoke a specific renderer for it because it is communicated as an interval in seconds. To make it visible and have it regularly updated for status "Downloading" also add the entry to the columns array. It should already be there in the fields array.
```javascript
var globals = {
  torrentStatus: {
    ...
    4: {
      label: "Downloading",
      columns: [... , "eta", ...],
      fields: [... , "eta", ...]
    },
    ...
  }
}

var torrentColumns = {
  ...
  "eta": {
    label: "ETA", render: function( seconds ) {
      return seconds ? renderDateTime( Date.now() / 1000 + seconds ) : "";
    }
  },
  ...
}
```
* "This functionality doesn't work on Google Chrome\*."
Ah, then you(!) have some 'splaining to do... and probably some work as well.
